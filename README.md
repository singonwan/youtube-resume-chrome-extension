## Youtube Resume Chrome Extension

Ever found yourself drowning in too many YouTube tabs because you don’t want to lose your place in a video? You keep them open, worried that closing a tab might mean losing your progress—leading to clutter, distractions, and overwhelm.

YouTube Resume solves this problem by automatically saving your last-watched timestamp, along with the video’s URL and title. Now, you can confidently close tabs without worrying about forgetting where you left off.

With YouTube Resume, you can:
✅ Save your progress—resume videos exactly where you left off.
✅ Remove individual videos when you’re done or no longer need them.
✅ Clear all saved videos for a fresh start whenever you want.

Close tabs freely, stay organized, and watch at your own pace—without the chaos.
