## Youtube Resume Chrome Extension

Ever found yourself drowning in too many YouTube tabs because you don’t want to lose your place in a video? You keep them open, worried that closing a tab might mean losing your progress—leading to clutter, distractions, and overwhelm.

YouTube Resume solves this problem by automatically saving your last-watched timestamp, along with the video’s URL and title. Now, you can confidently close tabs without worrying about forgetting where you left off.

With YouTube Resume, you can:
- ✅ Save your progress—resume videos exactly where you left off.
- ✅ Remove individual videos when you’re done or no longer need them.
- ✅ Clear all saved videos for a fresh start whenever you want.

Close tabs freely, stay organized, and watch at your own pace—without the chaos. 

## How to use the extension

The extension is very easy to use. Once installed, when you visit a video page on youtube, the extension will automatically start tracking your progress on the video. You will be able to see all the progress tracked in the popup of the extension. 

If you don't want the last-watched time-stamp of a video anymore, you simply click on the popup and click the 'Remove Video' button to remove that video or the 'Clear All' button to remove all the videos saved.
